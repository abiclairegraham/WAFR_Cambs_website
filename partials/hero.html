          <h1>Defending the Rights of All Women</h1>
          <p>Far-right groups exploit real fears about violence against women to spread racism and division - deflecting from the true causes of harm,  
              and creating hate towards some of our most vulnerable communities: migrants, refugees, minority religious communities and the LGBTQIA+ community.
          We stand with ALL women and marginalised communities against the far-right.</p>
